# MVVMPractice
A Simple MVVM practice. This is a number trivia [Number Trivia = http://numbersapi.com] search and store app, which has two screens </br>

1) List Fragment => shows list of stored trivia which the user saves </br>
2) Add Fragment => Has three options </br>
    => Search for Trivia </br>
    => Search Random Trivia </br>
    => Store Current Trivia [These are stored in database and are shown on the List Fragment] </br>
    
    
I have used **Model-View-ViewModel Architecture + LiveData + Room + Retrofit + Coroutines** to create this app
